# Reports-on-Accident
Road traffic accidents remain a major public health and safety concern across the United Kingdom, with thousands of casualties reported annually (Department for Transport, 2021). Understanding the temporal, spatial, and situational factors that contribute to these accidents is essential for designing effective interventions at both local and national levels. This project applies advanced data mining and predictive analytics techniques including association rule mining, clustering, and time series modelling to official road accident records (Stats19 dataset) for the years 2017â€“2019.
The analysis addresses seven key questions relating to when, where, and under what conditions accidents occur, with a particular focus on Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. By identifying patterns in accident timing, vehicle type, pedestrian involvement, and severity, as well as forecasting accident counts in high-risk areas, this report provides evidence-based recommendations to guide policy and interventions aimed at improving road safety.
